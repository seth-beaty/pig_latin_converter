# Readme (but only if you want to)
This is the second iteration of the Pig Latin Converter (version 1.1). There are still a number of goals to be accomplished. 
For example, I discovered that in the case of all capital phrases, it does not respond well. It also has trouble with 
quotes, but I suspect I shall fix these issues in time. As it stands, all you have to do is download the .exe file and run it.
To do so, the main.exe file is in the dist folder. Click on that folder and you will see it. Click on the main.exe file,
and then click the download button with the tooltip "Download RAW file" next to the "RAW" button and "Copy raw file" button.
Windows Defender may try to warn you about running the file. You can inspect the code yourself in main.py if you think
something harmful may be in it.

TODO:
- [x] Be able to process all capital phrases
- [x] Be able to process double quotes
- [ ] Be able to process single quotes?
